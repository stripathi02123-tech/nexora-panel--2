# Container Management

Container Management is the core NEXORA module. It covers creation, lifecycle operations, resource limits, network mappings, traffic statistics, password resets, and console access.

## Container List

The list page scans container status. Administrators can view all containers. Sub-users only see containers within their authorization scope.

Common fields include:

- ID, UUID, and name.
- Virtualization type.
- Runtime status.
- IP and IPv6.
- CPU, memory, and disk limits.
- Traffic usage and traffic limits.
- Expiration time.

## Create Containers

Creation requires a template and resource quotas. Batch creation is available from the panel or API and is useful for issuing multiple containers at once.

```http
POST /api/v1/containers
POST /api/v1/batch-create
```

Linux containers and Linux KVM virtual machines support SSH login configuration during creation:

- `auto_password`: generate a root SSH password automatically.
- `password`: use a custom `ssh_password`.
- `key`: write a one-line `ssh_public_key`; a password is still kept for WebSSH.

Network allocation can combine NAT, public IPv4, and IPv6 as needed. API fields such as `assign_nat`, `assign_ipv4`, `public_ipv4s`, `assign_ipv6`, and `ipv6_addresses` are optional. If they are omitted, default behavior is preserved.

## Lifecycle Operations

```http
POST /api/v1/containers/{id}/start
POST /api/v1/containers/{id}/stop
POST /api/v1/containers/{id}/restart
POST /api/v1/containers/{id}/reinstall
DELETE /api/v1/containers/{id}/delete
```

Start, stop, reinstall, and delete actions enter the task queue. Call `GET /api/v1/tasks` afterwards to check execution status.

When reinstalling a Linux system, you may pass `ssh_auth_mode`, `ssh_password`, and `ssh_public_key`. `ssh_auth_mode=keep` keeps the current SSH password. If these fields are omitted, the old behavior is preserved.

## Resources and Traffic

The container details page supports resource usage, traffic limit changes, resource limit changes, and expiration changes.

```http
GET /api/v1/containers/{id}/usage
GET /api/v1/containers/{id}/traffic
POST /api/v1/containers/{id}/traffic-reset
PUT /api/v1/containers/{id}/traffic-limit
PUT /api/v1/containers/{id}/resource-limit
PUT /api/v1/containers/{id}/expiry
```

## NAT Port Management

The NAT port management section supports adding, editing, and deleting mappings. Add and edit actions use a dialog so name, protocol, external port, and internal port can be filled in together.

```http
GET /api/v1/containers/{id}/random-port
POST /api/v1/containers/{id}/port-mappings
PUT /api/v1/containers/{id}/port-mappings/{index}
DELETE /api/v1/containers/{id}/port-mappings/{index}
```

In sub-user mode, administrators can limit sub-users to changing only the internal port, preventing changes to the host-facing port and protocol.

## Remote Console

```http
POST /api/v1/ssh-ticket
POST /api/v1/vnc-ticket
```

Tickets are short-lived. Use them immediately for WebSSH or WebVNC and do not persist them.
